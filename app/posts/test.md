    snippet: Using LLMs to solve by-target schema transformation
   

I started DataMorpher as a research aide, tasked with writing SQL to find ground-truth pipelines for Microsoft's AutoPipeline benchmark. 
As the project and my interest in it developed, I transitioned to a research role, developing novel components of the agentic framework and
running large scale experiments to evaluate our performance. 

This was my introduction into the world of research and you can read about it in a large DB conference soon!
